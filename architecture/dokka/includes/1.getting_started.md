### Step-by-step guide

1. Similarly to a standard Bukkit plugin, either define your `plugin.yml` as usual or
use the [plugin.yml Gradle plugin].
2. Extend `VoxelsPlugin` on your main plugin class instead of `JavaPlugin`.

### Key differences

1. You need to override `enable`, `disable`, and `load` instead of `onEnable`, `onDisable`,
   and `onLoad` respectively.
2. The plugin itself is a `CoroutineScope` and it integrates well with the built-in Bukkit
   scheduler. You can use `launch` and `async` to run coroutines on the main thread or
   a separate thread respectively.
3. Dispatchers are available for the main thread and asynchronous tasks. See
   `plugin.dispatchers` and `BukkitDispatchers` documentation for more information.
4. The plugin lifecycle methods are suspendable and can be used with coroutines.
5. You can define properties delegated by the plugin lifecycle state changes. In other
   words, the property is going to be unavailable until the plugin is enabled and react
   to the plugin being disabled. See `plugin#lifecycle` documentation for more information.

### Examples

**Simple VoxelsPlugin quickstart**
  
```kotlin
class MyPlugin : VoxelsPlugin(namespace = "myplugin") {
   val myProp by lifecycle(priority = 5) {
      println("myProp is initialized")
      "Hello World!"
   }
    override suspend fun enable() {
        logger.info("Hello, world!")
    }
}
```
