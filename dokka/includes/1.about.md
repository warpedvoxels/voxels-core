### About

Voxels is a comprehensive collection of utilities and abstractions to
streamline Minecraft server-side modding by simplifying the overall development process
and making it more enjoyable and less error-prone. This project is part of the larger
[WarpedVoxels] initiative, but can be used independently.

Minecraft server-side modding in Kotlin is incredibly powerful, although existing
tools and APIs often lack the flexibility and seamless integration needed to fully
leverage the power of the Kotlin programming language. This project aims to fill the
gap between the two, providing a solid foundation for any Minecraft project that 
uses the base game core features to build upon.

The primary focus of this project is on **modularity** and tight integration with Kotlin's
modern ecosystem, including, but not limited to, [kotlinx.coroutines], 
[kotlinx.serialization], and [Jetpack Compose].
