### Getting started

voxels-core is a modular API, allowing you to choose and integrate only the modules
that suit your project's requirements. To get started, you can refer to the
documentation pages of individual modules to understand their functionalities
and how to use them effectively.

When incorporating Voxels into your project, ensure that it is available at runtime.
Achieving this involves declaring another _plug-in_ that _shades_ all the necessary
modules into a single JAR file, which can then be loaded by the server. For example,
if you are using Gradle, you can use the [Shadow] plugin to achieve this.

You can find a sample project that uses voxels-core [here].
